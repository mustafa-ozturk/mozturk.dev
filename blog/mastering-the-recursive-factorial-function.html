				mastering the recursive factorial function
			</h1>
			<em>March 15, 2021</em>
			<p>
				Last night I was on HackerRank doing some problems, and I came
				across a simple factorial problem.
			</p>
			<p>This is how I solved it:</p>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/mustafa-ozturk/931a5ebc6acebe57ced3b1e527cb2f16.js"></script>
			<p>
				Although this solution was intuitive, I knew that there must be
				a cleaner-looking way of doing this. I quickly found a recursive
				function that does the same thing in fewer lines, but I just
				couldn't understand how.
			</p>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/mustafa-ozturk/5c124c20a7fd19014679e7db0d44ccde.js"></script>
			<p>
				I had previously read articles, watched videos, yet for some
				reason, recursion just wouldn't click in my head. I then went on
				my favorite discord server, and asked: "how does this function
				work?" and after an hour of back and forth (special thanks to
				Jawad and Ian). I now finally know how to use recursion, more
				specifically, how to use one to solve a factorial problem.
			</p>
			<p>
				To strengthen my own knowledge, I will try to explain how it
				works.
			</p>
			<p>Simply put, recursion is a function that calls itself.</p>
			<p>This is the recursive factorial function:</p>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/mustafa-ozturk/5c124c20a7fd19014679e7db0d44ccde.js"></script>
			<p>Let's say <code>n</code> is 4:</p>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/mustafa-ozturk/b2841932a80cca387add316e0d520794.js"></script>
			<p>
				This function will return <code>4 * factorial(4 - 1)</code>.
				<br />
				and to find out what <code>factorial(3)</code> is,
			</p>
			<p>It will call itself with 3 passed in as the argument</p>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/mustafa-ozturk/76adf7477e210fe06ff6f4c7da6c7d9b.js"></script>
			<p>
				<code>factorial(3)</code> will return
				<code>3 * factorial(3 - 1)</code>
				<br />
				and to find out what <code>factorial(2)</code> is,
			</p>
			<p>It will call itself with 2 passed in as the argument</p>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/mustafa-ozturk/18b9c93c7506cce1a2beb48a80796680.js"></script>
			<p>
				<code>factorial(2)</code> will return
				<code>2 * factorial(2 - 1)</code>
				<br />
				and to find out what <code>factorial(1)</code> is,
			</p>
			<p>It will call itself with 1 passed in as the argument</p>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/mustafa-ozturk/1b2d19443aeb06217a984c8eaaee6e74.js"></script>
			<p>now remember the if statement.</p>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/mustafa-ozturk/5a523dd167ac36a1ae348dad4cfc0dc5.js"></script>
			<p>
				Since <code>n</code> is no longer greater than 1 it will simply
				<code>return 1</code>
			</p>
			<p>
				This is called the "base case" and it means that there is no
				recursion left to do (i.e no function of itself left to call).
			</p>
			<p>
				Now that the function knows <code>factorial(1)</code> is equal
				to 1
				<br />
				then <code>factorial(2)</code> must equal 2 * 1
				<br />
				and <code>factorial(3)</code> must equal 3 * (2 * 1)
				<br />
				and <code>factorial(4)</code> must equal 4 * (3 * ( 2 * 1) )
				<br />
				and that equals to <code>24</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Understanding recursion was very satisfying. Hopefully, this
				makes sense to you.
